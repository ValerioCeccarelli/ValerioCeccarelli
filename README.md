I'm an Italian guy interested in computer science.

I have a Barcelor degree in Software Engineering at Sapienza of Rome, and now I'm enrolled in the Master's Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence course at Politecnico of Milan.

In 2023 I had the fantastic opportunity to be a Software Developing Engineer at Amazon in Luxembour; it was my first work experience and I loved it: I loved the role, the team and the office!
it was an important opportunity for personal growth where I was able to show my skills by facing real world challenges; I'm proud to have earned the team's trust, and to have made changes that now impact the entire Amazon network.

But computer science, as well as education and work, is my hobby: I like to experiment and learn new technologies and new programming languages as shown by my repositories.
My idea is that to be an excellent SDE you need to know many things so that you can choose the right technology to solve a problem; 

After all, though, my favorite language is

I've done a lot of projects with it like [Turball](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ValerioEngine.Turball), an arcade game developed with Unity for Android and published on the Google Play Store.
